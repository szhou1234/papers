A couple of months ago,
<a href="http://blog.basho.com/2010/01/29/why-vector-clocks-are-easy/">
Bryan wrote about vector clocks
</a>
on this blog.  The title of the post was "Why Vector Clocks are Easy";
anyone who read the post would realize that he meant that they're easy
for a client to use when talking to a system that implements them.
For that reason, there is no reason to fear or avoid using a service
that exposes the existence of vector clocks in its API.
</p><p>
Of course, actually implementing such a system is not easy.  Two of
the hardest things are deciding what an actor is (i.e. where the
incrementing and resolution is, and what parties get their own field
in the vector) and how to keep vclocks from growing without bound over
time.
</p><p>
In Bryan's example the parties that actually proposed changes
("clients") were the actors in the vector clocks.  This is the model
that vector clocks are designed for and work well with, but it has a
drawback.  The width of the vectors will grow proportionally with the
number of clients.  In a group of friends deciding when to have dinner
this isn't a problem, but in a distributed storage system the number
of clients over time can be large.  Once the vector clocks get that
large, they not only take up more space in disk and RAM but also take
longer to compute comparisons over.
</p><p>
Let's run through that same example again, but this time visualize the
vector clocks throughout the scenario.  If you don't recall the whole
story in the example, you should
<a href="http://blog.basho.com/2010/01/29/why-vector-clocks-are-easy/">
read Bryan's post again</a>
as I am just going to show the data flow aspect of it here.
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Vector Clocks by Example, in detail</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Start with Alice's initial message where she suggests Wednesday.
(In the diagrams I abbreviate names, so that "Alice" will be "A" in the
vclocks and so on for Ben, Cathy, and Dave.)
</p>
<pre class="example">
date = Wednesday
vclock = Alice:1
</pre>
<img src="a-vectors-6.png">
<p>
Ben suggests Tuesday:
</p>
<pre class="example">
date = Tuesday
vclock = Alice:1, Ben:1
</pre>
<img src="a-vectors-5.png">
<p>
Dave replies, confirming Tuesday:
</p>
<pre class="example">
date = Tuesday
vclock = Alice:1, Ben:1, Dave:1
</pre>
<img src="a-vectors-4.png">
<p>
Now Cathy gets into the act, suggesting Thursday:
</p>
<pre class="example">
date = Thursday
vclock = Alice:1, Cathy:1
</pre>
<img src="a-vectors-3.png">
<p>
Dave has two conflicting objects:
</p>
<pre class="example">
date = Tuesday
vclock = Alice:1, Ben:1, Dave:1
</pre>
<p>
and
</p>
<pre class="example">
date = Thursday
vclock = Alice:1, Cathy:1
</pre>
<p>
Dave can tell that these versions are in conflict, because neither
vclock "descends" from the other.
Luckily, Dave's a reasonable guy, and chooses Thursday.  Dave also
created a vector clock that is a successor to all 
previously-seen vector clocks.  He emails this value back to Cathy.
</p>
<pre class="example">
date = Thursday
vclock = Alice:1, Ben:1, Cathy:1, Dave:2
</pre>
<img src="a-vectors-2.png">
<p>
So now when Alice asks Ben and Cathy for the latest decision, the
replies she receives are, from Ben:
</p>
<pre class="example">
date = Tuesday
vclock = Alice:1, Ben:1, Dave:1
</pre>
<p>
and from Cathy:
</p>
<pre class="example">
date = Thursday
vclock = Alice:1, Ben:1, Cathy:1, Dave:2
</pre>
<img src="a-vectors-1.png">
<p>
From this, she can tell that Dave intended his correspondence with
Cathy to override the decision he made with Ben.  All Alice has to
do is show Ben the vector clock from Cathy's message, and Ben will
know that he has been overruled.
</p>
<img src="a-vectors.png">
<p>
That worked out pretty well.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Making it Easier Makes it Harder</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Notice that even in this short
and simple example the vector clock grew from nothing up to a 4-pairs
mapping?  In a real world scenario with long-lived data, each data
element would end up with a vector clock with a length proportional to
the number of clients that had ever modified it.  That's a
(potentially unbounded) large growth in storage volume and
computation, so it's a good idea to think about how to prevent it.
</p>
<p>
One straightforward idea is to make the servers handling client
requests be the "actors", instead of representing the clients
directly. Since any given system usually has a known bounded number of
servers over time and also usually has less servers than clients, this
serves to reduce and cap the size of the vclocks. I know of at least
two real systems that have tried this. In addition to keeping growth
under control, this approach attracts people because it means you
don't expose "hard" things like vector clocks to clients at all.
</p>
<p>
Let's think through the same example, but with that difference, to see
how it goes. We'll assume that a 2-server distributed system is
coordinating the communication, with clients evenly distributed among
them. We'll be easy on ourselves and allow for client affinity, so for
the duration of the session each client will use only one
server. Alice and Dave happen to get server X, and Ben and Cathy get
server Y.  To avoid getting too complicated here I am not going to
draw the server communication; instead I'll just abstract over it by
changing the vector clocks accordingly.
</p>
<p>
We're fine through the first few steps:
</p>
<img src="c-vectors-1.png">
<p>
The only real difference so far is that each update increments a
vector clock field named for the client's chosen server instead of the
client itself.  This will mean that the number of fields needed won't
grow without bound; it will be the same as the number of servers.
This is the desired effect of the change.
</p>
<p>
We run into trouble, though, when Cathy sends her update:
</p>
<img src="c-vectors.png">
<p>
In the original example, this is where a conflict was created.  Dave
sorted out the conflict, and everything was fine.  With our new
strategy, though, something else happened.  Ben and Cathy were both
modifying from the same original object.  Since we used their server
id instead of their own name to identify the change, Cathy's message
has the same vector clock as Ben's!  This means that Dave's message
(responding to Ben) appears to be a simple successor to Cathy's... and
we lose her data silently!
</p>
<p>
Clearly, this approach won't work.  Remember the two systems I
mentioned that tried this approach?  Neither of them stuck with it
once they discovered that it can be expected to silently lose updates.
</p>
<p>
For vector clocks to have their desired effect without causing
accidents such as this, the elements represented by the fields in the
vclock must be the real units of concurrency.  In a case like this
little example or a distributed storage system, that means client
identifiers, not server-based ones.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Just Lose a Little Information and Everything Will Be Fine</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
If we use client identifiers, we're back in the situation where vector
clocks will grow and grow as more clients use a system over time.  The
solution most people end up with is to "prune" their vector clocks as
they grow.
</p>
<p>
This is done by adding a timestamp to each field, and updating it to
the current local time whenever that field is incremented.  This
timestamp is never used for vclock comparison -- that is purely a
matter of logical time -- but is only for pruning purposes.
</p>
<p>
This way, when a given vclock gets too big, you can remove fields,
starting at the one that was updated longest ago, until you hit a
size/age threshold that makes sense for your application.
</p>
<p>
But, you ask, doesn't this lose information?
</p>
<p>
Yes, it does -- but it won't make you lose your data.  The only
case where this kind of pruning will matter at all is when a client
holds a very old copy of the unpruned vclock and submits data descended
from that.  This will create a sibling (conflict)
even though you might have been able to resolve it automatically if you had the
complete unpruned vclock at the server.  That is the tradeoff with
pruning: in exchange for keeping growth under control, you run the
chance of occasionally having to do a "false merge"... but you never
lose data quietly, which makes this approach unequivocally better than
moving the field identifiers off of the real client and onto the server.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Review </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
So, vclocks are hard: even with perfect implementation you can't have
perfect information about causality in an open system without
unbounded information growth.  Realize this and design accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Of course, that is just advice for people building brand new
distributed systems or trying to improve existing ones.
Using <a href="http://basho.com/Riak.html">a system that exposes vclocks</a>
is still easy.
